        <p>Phase 1 of the experiment will now begin. You will take turns being either <em>drawer</em> or <em>guesser</em>. In Phase 1, six sentences will be shown.</p>
        <p>When your role is <em>drawer</em>, one sentence will be highlighted in green. Your task is to make a drawing to communicate the highlighted sentence to the <em>guesser</em>. Please do NOT use any letters, words, or numbers while drawing. The aim is to make a drawing that the <em>guesser</em> will be able to successfully distinguish from the other sentences. When you are satisfied with your drawing, simply click the ‘Done’-button to send the drawing to the <em>guesser</em>.</p>
        <p>When your role is <em>guesser</em>, you simply have to wait until the <em>drawer</em> sends you a drawing. When you receive a drawing, please click on the the sentence you think matches the drawing and press the select button. You will be notified whether your guess was right or wrong. </p>
        <p>After each round the roles of <em>drawer</em> and <em>guesser</em> will be switched. This setup will be repeated throughout all three phases of the experiment.</p>
    {% elif subsession.round_number == 2 %}
        <p>This was all for Phase 1 of the experiment – good job! Phase 2 will now begin. In Phase 2, 12 new sentences will be shown. Apart from this, your task and the procedure are the same as in Phase 1.</p>
    {% elif subsession.round_number == 3 %}
        <p>This was all for Phase 2 – good job! Phase 3 of the experiment will now begin. In Phase 3, 24 new sentences will be shown. Apart from this, your task and the procedure are the same as in Phase 1 and 2.</p>
